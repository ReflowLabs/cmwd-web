Chiang Mai Web Developers Meetup is a newly-launched regularly-scheduled knowledge-sharing event that invites all developers, aspiring developers and the web-curious to enjoy technical presentations and mingle with like minded attendees.

Join us on the last Monday of every month for intriguing and exciting topics that cover the latest trends in web technologies, frameworks, languages and libraries. Whether you are an absolute beginner or a battle-hardened veteran, you’re sure to acquire valuable knowledge about a wide number of topics in the ever-changing web development landscape.

Our first event will be on **30th November 2020 at 6pm**. _Yellow Co-Working_ in Nimman have kindly offered their venue for us to use for presentations.

We will be taking a look at WebVR (browser-based virtual reality) and what’s possible using the powerful new React.js library `react-three-fibers`. Additionally there will be a presentation on the state of hardware token security, where you’ll learn the best practices for securing your accounts with FIDO2 and YubiKeys.

Following the main event, some of us may stick around for dinner, drinks and discussion deep into the night.

If you’d like to present a topic at future events that is in any way related to web development, we’d love to hear from you - get in touch at [speak@cmwd.io](mailto:speak@cmwd.io).

### All Welcome. Free Entry. Free Water.
